<h1> Building a personal website following the Software Development Lifecycle</h1>
<p> This page documents my first public personal project. The idea is to follow the waterfall approach of the sofware development lifecycle and apply each phase concously, showing the ins and outs of each phase.
The idea is to do this iteratively, as the blog improves and I want to work on a certain technology, I'll improve the website.</p>
